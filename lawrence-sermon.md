On Sunday, December 29, 1723, Christ Church was first opened for worship. The sermon was preached by the Rector, the Rev. Timothy Cutler, on the text, "For mine house shall be called an house of prayer for all people." On Sunday, December 29, 1912, Chirst Church, which had been closed for six months for a complete restoration, was opened for service; the sermon was preached by the Rector, the Rt. Rev. William Lawrence, who took the same text.

It was a brilliant, mild, winter's day. There was the administration of the Lord's Supper at ten o'clock, when a goodly number of the old member of Christ Church met. At eleven o'clock the church was packed with a great congregation of people from the neighborhood, from all parts of the city, and from distant states. Representatives of several historical societies at that time in convention in Boston were present, including the President of the American Historical Association (Colonel Roosevelt).

The following pages give the order of service and sermon. After the closing hymn, Bishop Lawrence returned to the Church and told the people how the purpose of the restoration had been so carried out as to bring Christ Church back to its original dignity and beauty, much credit being given by him to Mr. R. Clipston Sturgis, Mr. Henry C. Ross, and the two wardens, Messrs. Bolton and Sanby, who as a labor of love had given their best thought and time to the restoration.

At half past three in the afternoon the doors were thrown open, and the Church was filled with people of the neighborhood and the city to listen to an hour of sacred music.

"Almighty God, who in the former time didst lead our fathers forth into a wealthy place; give thy grace, we humbly beseech thee, to us their children, that we may always approve ourselves a people mindful of thy favour and glad to do thy will. Bless our land with honourable industry, sound learning, and pure manners. Defend our liberties, preserve our unity. Save us from violence, discord, and confusion, from pride and arrogancy, and from every evil way. Fashion into one happy people the multitudes brought hither out of many kindreds and tongues. Endue with the spirit of wisdom those whom we intrust in thy Name with the authority of governance, to the end that there may be peace at home, and that we keep a place among the nations of the earth. In the time of prosperity fill our hearts with thankfulness; an d in the day of trouble suffer not out trust in thee to fail; all of which we ask for Jesus Christ's sake. Amen."
